      temporarily transferred to your organisation, and the costs of freelance
      staff to help develop your project. Do not include the costs of paying
      trainees here.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You must also openly advertise all project staff posts, unless, you have

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you are extending the hours of a suitably qualified member of staff
      on your payroll, so that they can work on the project. In this case we
      will fund the cost of the additional hours spent on the project and you
      will need to tell us about their role.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you are moving an existing member of staff into a post created by the
      project, then your grant can either pay for the cost of this member of
      staff, or for the cost of backfilling their position.

      Evaluation
    </h3>

      This cost heading is mandatory. All projects must be evaluated. Our
      advice is to budget up to 5% of your costs towards evaluation. Depending
      on the scale of the project and how complicated it is, you may want to
      employ somebody to help evaluate your project and assess whether you are
      successfully achieving the outcomes you set out in your application.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Contingency
    </h3>

      This cost heading is mandatory. A contingency is only used to pay for
      unexpected costs required to deliver your project. The total contingency
      figure may be up to 10% of the total costs of the project, unless you
      have a particularly complex capital project where a higher level may be
      required. Make sure that you only include your required contingency here
      and not included within the other cost headings in the application.
