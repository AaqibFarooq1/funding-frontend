# Note: As it stands, the translations here match the Salesforce picklist values
#
# This file principally lists the salesforce picklist values, alongside a key that
# is generated from "the picklist string".parameterize.underscore
#
# Controllers, like the spends controllers in the arrears journeys,
# paramterize.underscore the picklist values from Salesforce so that the
# corresponding translations can be used in the cy.yml for Welsh users.
#
# Both this file, and the cy.yml are used to convert the text back to picklist values.
