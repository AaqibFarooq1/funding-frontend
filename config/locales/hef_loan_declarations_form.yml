It can be found on the National Lottery Heritage Fund website.</p>
        <p class=\"govuk-body\">The personal information we have collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money- laundering and to verify your identity. If fraud is detected, you could be refused a grant or loan. Further details of how your information will be used by us and these fraud prevention agencies, and your data protection rights, can be found by contacting fair.processing@heritagefund.org.uk</p>"
