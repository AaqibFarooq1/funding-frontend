    page_hint: "Briefs describe any work you plan to commission during your project. If you are commissioning work (e.g. from an artist or architect) then you should submit a brief. The brief should describe the works, how long they will take, and how much they will cost. You can find a template brief on our website. For fees over £10,000 you should obtain 3 competitive tenders or quotes, for fees over £50,000 we will expect you to provide proof of the competitive tendering process."
